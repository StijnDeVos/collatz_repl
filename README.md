# collatz_repl
A very simple REPL that prints Collatz sequences. There is no purpose or value to this except to practise programming in Python. 

TO-DO:

- visualize stopping times for given starting values
- implement memoization
- add a command `plot n file_name.png` that writes a plot to disk
- improve `parse_input` function to facilitate extendibility
