# collatz_repl
A very simple REPL that prints Collatz sequences. There is no value to this except to practise programming in Python. 

TO-DO:

- visualize stopping times for given starting values
- implement memoization
- extend the `plot` command to take an additional argument `file_path` that allows the user to write a plot to disk
- improve `parse_input` logic to facilitate extendibility
